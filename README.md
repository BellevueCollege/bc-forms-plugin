Gravity Forms External Data Fields Plugin
=================================

This plugin connects to our DataAPI to provide student or employee information to prefill GF forms.

This plugin was developed with the following:

+   PHP 5.5
+   WordPress 4.75
+   Gravity Forms
+   BC Data API

### Configuration

After installation, create a `config.php` file in the main directory using the sample config file (`config-sample.php`) as an example.

### Updates

May 2017 - The plugin was updated to change from getting data directory from ODS/connection to MSSQL to using the new BC DataAPI. The plugin was massively refactored with this update.
